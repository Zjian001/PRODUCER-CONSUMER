### Overview
    This Java program simulates a producer-consumer scenario using a shared buffer. It utilizes multiple threads to represent producers and consumers. The main goal is to measure the turnaround time under different configurations.

### Usage
* Compile the Program: 
    ## "javac PRO.java"
* Run the Program: Provide the sleep time as a command-line argument.
*   ## "java PRO <sleep_time>"
* Replace <sleep_time> with the desired sleep time in milliseconds.
### Sample Command
 ## 'java PRO 100'
 * This command runs the program with a sleep time of 100 milliseconds.
### Output:
    The program will execute multiple test cases with different configurations of producers and consumers.
    Results will be appended to the sample_output.txt file.
### Parameters
* The program takes a single command-line argument representing the sleep time used by producers and consumers.
* Test cases are defined in the testCases array within the main method. Each test case is represented as an array [producers, consumers].

### Results
    The program measures the turnaround time for each test case and appends the results to the 'sample_output.txt' file.
